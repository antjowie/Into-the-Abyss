# Into the Abyss
*NOTE: I use this project as a means to learn C#. I will most likely reject pull requests but feel free to fork the project.*
## What is it?
It is a 2D procedurally generated dungeon crawler game based around precise movement. It will also support local multiplayer. You play as a character that uses a sword to cut its way through problems and bullets. You fight against gunners. Everyone kills each other in one hit, so be careful when moving around. The game is meant to be short and is based around time.

## How do I play it
You can download the latest release [under the release page](https://github.com/antjowie/Into-the-Abyss/releases). Right now however, the game is still in early development and no version will probably be available. You can always build the game yourself.  
We use [Unity](https://unity.com/) for development. We use version **2018.4.4f1**. Just clone the repo and add it as a existing project, from there, you should be able to build it.
